            <h2>Chapter 1: The routine</h2>
            <p>## Part 1: The Morning Ritual

                The alarm's shrill cry pierced the darkness at precisely 5:30 AM, as it had every weekday for the past three years. Arys's eyes snapped open, his hand already moving to silence the noise before it could sound a second time. He lay still for a moment, staring at the ceiling, allowing his mind to boot up like the computers he would soon face at work.
                
                With a soft groan, he swung his legs over the side of the bed. The floorboards creaked under his feet, a familiar sound in the otherwise silent apartment. Arys moved through the darkness with practiced ease, his pale skin seeming to glow faintly in the pre-dawn gloom. He caught a glimpse of himself in the bathroom mirror – disheveled dark hair, sharp features, and those strange black veins visible beneath his skin. They seemed more pronounced in the morning, like ink spreading through paper.
                
                The shower came next, exactly four minutes long. As the water cascaded over him, Arys mentally prepared for the day ahead. Eighty calls, give or take. Eighty times he'd have to say, "Thank you for calling Spectrum, my name is Arys, how can I help you?" Eighty opportunities for something to go wrong.
                
                He dried off, dressed in his usual attire – a crisp white shirt and dark slacks – and made his way to the kitchen. The coffee maker gurgled to life, programmed to start brewing at 5:40 AM. While it worked, Arys attended to his other morning responsibility.
                
                In the spare room, rows of terrariums lined the walls. The soft glow of heat lamps illuminated a menagerie of scales and exoskeletons. Arys felt the tension in his shoulders ease as he entered this space. Here, among his cold-blooded companions, he found a measure of peace.
                
                "Good morning," he murmured, his voice softer than it would be all day. He moved from tank to tank, checking water levels, temperatures, and looking for any signs of distress. The tarantulas were motionless, legs curled beneath them. The leopard gecko flicked its tongue lazily as Arys spritzed its enclosure. In the largest tank, a ball python uncoiled slowly, its eyes fixing on him with what he liked to imagine was recognition.
                
                These creatures asked nothing of him but the essentials – food, water, warmth. They didn't demand explanations about bills or complain about service outages. In their presence, Arys felt the anxious knot in his chest loosen, if only for a moment.
                
                The coffee maker beeped, drawing him back to the kitchen. He poured the steaming liquid into a travel mug, adding neither cream nor sugar. The bitterness would help sharpen his focus for the long day ahead.
                
                At 6:00 AM sharp, Arys locked his apartment door behind him. The city was just beginning to stir as he made his way to the parking lot. Early risers hurried past, clutching their own travel mugs like talismans against the morning chill. The unnamed city – so similar to Denver that he sometimes forgot it wasn't – was shaking off its slumber.
                
                Arys's sedan started on the first try, as always. He pulled out of the lot, merging into the steadily increasing flow of traffic. The radio remained off; he preferred the relative quiet, using the time to mentally rehearse his opening lines, to steel himself for the onslaught of voices that would soon fill his ears.
                
                As he drove, the sky lightened from inky black to deep blue, then to the pale lavender of dawn. Arys watched the transformation with detached interest, his mind already at his desk, already fielding calls, already counting down the hours until he could return to the sanctuary of his apartment and his pets.
                
                The call center loomed ahead, a nondescript building that somehow managed to look both mundane and vaguely menacing. Arys pulled into his usual parking spot at 7:25 AM, five minutes before his shift was set to begin. He took a final swig of coffee, grabbed his ID badge, and stepped out of the car.
                
                Another day was beginning. Another series of identical hours stretched before him. Another opportunity for something to go terribly, unexpectedly wrong.
                
                Arys squared his shoulders and walked toward the building, unaware that today, finally, something would.
            
                ## Part 2: The First Call

                The call center hummed with subdued activity as Arys made his way to his cubicle. Fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting a harsh glow that made everyone look slightly ill. He nodded curtly to a few colleagues, their faces as familiar and unremarkable as the gray fabric of the cubicle walls.
                
                Arys's workspace was a study in minimalism. A company-issued computer, a headset, a small notepad, and a single framed photo of a Brazilian salmon pink tarantula – these were the only items that marked the space as his. He settled into his chair, its creak a familiar prelude to the day ahead.
                
                7:29 AM. One minute to go. Arys closed his eyes, took a deep breath, and centered himself. When he opened them again, his face had settled into a mask of calm professionalism. He logged into the system, the glowing screen bathing his pale features in an eerie light that seemed to make his black veins pulse.
                
                The clock ticked over to 7:30 AM. Right on cue, his headset chirped. Arys's finger moved to accept the call, muscle memory taking over.
                
                "Thank you for calling Spectrum. My name is Arys. How can I help you today?" His voice was smooth, practiced, devoid of the tension coiled in his chest.
                
                "Yeah, hi," a gruff voice responded. "My internet's out. Again. Third time this month."
                
                Arys's fingers flew over the keyboard, pulling up the customer's information. *Robert Jennings, 1255 Maple Street. Indeed, third outage report in 30 days.* 
                
                "I understand how frustrating that must be, Mr. Jennings. I'd be happy to help you resolve this issue. Can you tell me when you first noticed the problem?"
                
                As the customer launched into a lengthy complaint about the unreliability of their service, Arys felt a familiar detachment settle over him. Part of his mind focused on the call, asking the necessary questions, guiding the conversation toward a resolution. Another part observed, cataloging the customer's tone, the background noises, the subtle tells that would help him navigate the interaction.
                
                And a third part, buried deep, seethed. *This is what you've become,* it whispered. *A robot in human skin, parroting the same lines day after day.*
                
                Arys pushed the thought aside, focusing on the task at hand. "I see, Mr. Jennings. I'm going to run a diagnostic on your line. This will just take a moment."
                
                As he initiated the test, Arys glanced at the photo on his desk. The tarantula's eyes seemed to stare back at him, eight points of stillness in the chaotic world of customer service. He envied its simplicity of existence.
                
                The diagnostic completed with a soft ping. "Mr. Jennings, I've identified an issue with the signal strength to your home. I'm going to reset your connection remotely. You should see your router lights begin to flash in just a moment."
                
                "Well, it's about time," Mr. Jennings grumbled. "You know, I've been a customer for fifteen years, and I gotta say, the service ain't what it used to be."
                
                *Fifteen years of the same complaints, the same problems, the same solutions,* Arys thought. Out loud, he said, "I apologize for the inconvenience, Mr. Jennings. We value your long-standing loyalty. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?"
                
                "No, that's it. Just get it fixed."
                
                "Certainly, sir. Thank you for your patience. Have a great day." Arys ended the call, the fake smile he'd worn throughout dropping from his face like a discarded mask.
                
                One down. Seventy-nine to go.
                
                He had exactly thirty seconds before the next call would come in. Arys used them to roll his shoulders, trying to release some of the tension that had already begun to build. As he did, he caught sight of his reflection in the computer screen. For a moment, just a moment, he thought he saw something shift beneath his skin, the black veins seeming to writhe like agitated snakes.
                
                Arys blinked, and the illusion vanished. He shook his head, dismissing it as a trick of the light, a product of too little sleep and too much caffeine.
                
                The headset chirped again. Arys straightened in his chair, his professional mask sliding back into place.
                
                "Thank you for calling Spectrum. My name is Arys. How can I help you today?"
                
                The cycle began anew.
                
                ## Part 3: The Midday Slump

The hours ticked by, each call blending into the next like colors in a child's finger painting. Arys's responses had become almost autonomic, his brain operating on two distinct tracks: one handling the calls with practiced efficiency, the other screaming in silent frustration.

As the clock crawled towards noon, Arys felt the familiar midday fatigue setting in. His head throbbed dully, a pressure building behind his eyes. The voices on the other end of the line seemed to grow more grating, more demanding with each passing minute.

"Thank you for calling Spectrum. My name is Arys. How can I help you today?" The words fell from his lips for what felt like the thousandth time.

"It's about time someone answered!" The shrill voice on the other end made Arys wince. "I've been on hold for twenty minutes!"

Arys glanced at the call timer. Eight minutes and thirteen seconds. He swallowed the urge to correct the customer. "I apologize for the wait, ma'am. I'd be happy to assist you. May I have your name and account number, please?"

"Margaret Holloway, account number 78291-054. And you'd better do more than just 'assist' me, young man. I want answers!"

Arys's fingers flew over the keyboard, pulling up Margaret's account information. Multiple calls in the past week, each marked 'resolved' by the previous representative. He suppressed a sigh.

"I understand your frustration, Mrs. Holloway. Can you tell me what seems to be the problem?"

What followed was a fifteen-minute tirade about channels disappearing, remotes not working, and picture quality that was "fuzzier than a peach." Arys listened, interjecting at appropriate intervals with sympathetic noises and clarifying questions.

As Margaret ranted, Arys felt a strange sensation building in his chest. It was as if a shadow was growing inside him, feeding on each sharp word and accusation. His veins seemed to darken, standing out starkly against his pale skin.

"Mrs. Holloway," he interrupted, his voice taking on an unusual timbre. "I understand you're upset. But has it occurred to you that perhaps the problem isn't with our service?"

The words slipped out before he could stop them, smooth and dark as oil. For a moment, there was silence on the other end of the line.

Arys blinked, shocked at his own audacity. But before he could backpedal, Margaret spoke again, her tone surprisingly subdued.

"I... well, I suppose I haven't considered that. My grandson was fiddling with the TV last weekend. Do you think he might have changed something?"

The shadow in Arys's chest receded, leaving him feeling hollow and slightly dizzy. "That's... that's certainly possible, Mrs. Holloway. Why don't we start by checking your TV settings?"

The rest of the call proceeded smoothly, ending with a grateful Margaret and a resolution that didn't require a technician visit. As Arys ended the call, he stared at his hands, flexing his fingers as if to make sure they were still under his control.

"Tough one, huh?"

Arys started at the voice, looking up to see Lila leaning against his cubicle wall. Her dark eyes were warm with sympathy, a stark contrast to the cool blues and grays of the office.

"You could say that," Arys muttered, glancing at the clock. 12:30 PM. Break time.

Lila fell into step beside him as they made their way to the break room. "You handled it well, though. I thought Mrs. Holloway was going to burst a blood vessel, but you calmed her right down."

Arys frowned, the memory of that strange moment nagging at him. "I'm not sure what happened, to be honest. It was... odd."

Lila bumped his shoulder playfully. "Don't overthink it. Sometimes customers just need a firm hand. Or voice, in our case."

They reached the break room, its stark fluorescent lighting a match for the call floor. Arys sank into a chair, unwrapping the sandwich he'd prepared that morning. Each bite was mechanical, fuel for the afternoon ahead.

Lila chatted about office gossip, her voice a soothing backdrop to Arys's whirling thoughts. He nodded at appropriate intervals, but his mind was elsewhere, replaying the call with Margaret, trying to understand the shadow he'd felt growing inside him.

All too soon, their fifteen minutes were up. Lila stood, stretching. "Back to the grind. You good?"

Arys nodded, forcing a smile that didn't reach his eyes. "Always."

As they walked back to their desks, Arys felt the weight of the afternoon settling onto his shoulders. The shadow inside him stirred restlessly, as if awakened by the brief respite.

He sat down, adjusted his headset, and took a deep breath. The phone chirped.

"Thank you for calling Spectrum. My name is Arys. How can I help you today?"

The cycle continued, but something had shifted. A crack had appeared in the routine, and through it, something dark and unfamiliar was beginning to seep.

## Part 4: The Unusual Incident

The afternoon dragged on, a parade of voices and problems that blurred together in Arys's mind. He felt stretched thin, like butter scraped over too much bread. The shadow inside him seemed to pulse with each call, growing incrementally with every "How can I help you today?"

At 4:17 PM, with forty-three minutes left in his shift, Arys's headset chirped once more. He took a deep breath, centering himself before answering.

"Thank you for calling Spectrum. My name is Arys. How can I help you today?"

"Hello," a soft, tremulous voice responded. "I... I'm not sure you can help me. I don't even know if this is the right number to call."

Arys frowned, his scripted response dying on his lips. There was something in the caller's voice – fear, perhaps, or deep distress – that cut through his fatigue like a knife.

"I'm here to assist you with whatever you need," he said, his tone gentler than usual. "Can you tell me what's going on?"

"It's my TV," the woman said, her voice barely above a whisper. "There's... there's something wrong with it. I know how that sounds, but... I'm scared."

Arys's frown deepened. "Can you elaborate on what you mean by 'wrong,' ma'am?"

"It's showing things. Terrible things. Things that haven't happened yet, but... but I think they will." The woman's voice cracked. "I saw my son. He was... oh God, there was so much blood."

A chill ran down Arys's spine. This was far outside the realm of typical customer service. He should transfer the call, escalate it to a supervisor. Instead, he found himself leaning closer to the screen, as if he could reach through it to the distressed woman on the other end.

"Ma'am, I want you to take a deep breath. Can you do that for me?" 

He heard her shaky inhale and exhale. 

"Good," he continued. "Now, I need you to listen to me very carefully. What you're seeing isn't real. It's not the future. It's just... shadows. Reflections of fear, nothing more."

As he spoke, Arys felt that now-familiar darkness stirring inside him. But this time, instead of feeding on negativity, it seemed to be reaching out, extending through the phone line towards the frightened woman.

"How... how can you be sure?" she asked, a desperate hope in her voice.

Arys closed his eyes, concentrating on the shadow within. "Because I can see them too," he said, the words coming from someplace deep and unknown. "The shadows, the fears. They're loud and they're frightening, but they're not real. Not unless we make them real."

He could feel something happening, a connection forming between himself and the caller. The shadow extended, touched her, and suddenly Arys could *see*. Not with his eyes, but with some other sense. He saw the woman's fear as a dark cloud around her, saw the malevolent images flickering on her TV screen.

And he saw how to dispel them.

"I want you to walk to your TV," Arys said, his voice taking on that strange, compelling quality it had with Mrs. Holloway. "Don't look at the screen. Just reach out and place your hand on it."

He heard movement, then a soft gasp. "It's... it's warm."

"That's right," Arys said, though he had no idea how he knew this. "Now, imagine all those frightening images being drawn into your hand. They're just shadows, and shadows can't exist in the light. You're going to pull them out of the TV and into yourself, where they'll dissolve like mist in the sun."

As he spoke, Arys felt the shadow inside him pulse and grow. It wasn't painful, but it was intense, like a muscle being used for the first time. 

"I... I think it's working," the woman said, awe replacing fear in her voice. "The images... they're fading."

Arys exhaled slowly, feeling the connection between them start to dissipate. "Good. That's very good. How do you feel now?"

"I feel... lighter. Like I've put down a heavy weight I didn't know I was carrying." There was a pause, then, "Thank you. I don't understand what just happened, but... thank you."

"You're welcome," Arys said, suddenly feeling exhausted. "Is there anything else I can help you with today?"

"No, I... I think I'm okay now. Thank you again."

The call ended, and Arys slumped in his chair, drained in a way he'd never experienced before. He looked at his hands, half-expecting to see the shadow leaking from his fingertips. But they looked normal – pale skin, black veins.

Only... were the veins darker than before? More pronounced?

A movement caught his eye, and he looked up to see Lila staring at him from her cubicle, her eyes wide with a mixture of concern and... was that fear?

"Arys," she said, her voice hushed. "What did you just do?"

Before he could answer, a sharp pain lanced through his head. The fluorescent lights suddenly seemed too bright, the office noises too loud. The world tilted sickeningly.

The last thing Arys saw before darkness claimed him was Lila rushing towards him, her mouth open in a shout he couldn't hear.

Then, nothing but shadows.

## Part 5: The Evening Wind-Down

Consciousness returned to Arys slowly, like a tide creeping up a shore. The first thing he became aware of was the smell – antiseptic and sterile. Not the stale coffee and desperation scent of the call center. He blinked, his vision swimming into focus.

White ceiling. Beeping machines. A hospital room.

"Welcome back to the land of the living."

Arys turned his head, wincing at the movement. Lila sat in a chair beside the bed, dark circles under her eyes suggesting she'd been there for some time.

"What happened?" Arys croaked, his throat dry.

Lila leaned forward, offering him a cup of water. "You collapsed. Right after that weird call. You've been out for a couple of hours."

Arys sipped the water, fragments of memory flashing through his mind. The frightened woman. The shadows. The inexplicable connection he'd felt.

"The doctors couldn't find anything wrong," Lila continued. "They're chalking it up to stress and exhaustion."

*If only it were that simple*, Arys thought. Out loud, he said, "I'm sorry for causing trouble."

Lila waved off his apology. "Please. You gave us the most excitement we've had in months. Though..." She hesitated, biting her lip. "Arys, what happened on that call? I've never seen anything like it. It was as if... as if you were glowing. But dark, if that makes any sense."

Arys closed his eyes, suddenly very tired. "I don't know, Lila. I really don't know."

A knock at the door saved him from further questioning. A doctor entered, clipboard in hand. "Mr. Zellinger? Good to see you awake. How are you feeling?"

The next half hour was a blur of tests and questions. In the end, as Lila had said, they found nothing concretely wrong. Stress, exhaustion, possibly a migraine. Arys nodded along, not bothering to explain that it felt like something fundamental had shifted inside him.

By 7:30 PM, Arys was stepping out of a taxi in front of his apartment building. Lila had offered to drive him, but he'd insisted on going alone. He needed time to think, to process.

The familiar walls of his apartment greeted him, unchanged despite the seismic shift in his world. Arys moved through his evening routine on autopilot – hanging up his jacket, removing his shoes, washing his hands.

In the bathroom, he paused, staring at his reflection. His skin seemed paler than usual, the black veins more pronounced. As he watched, he could swear he saw them pulse, like living things beneath his skin.

Shaking his head, Arys made his way to the spare room. The soft glow of heat lamps welcomed him, along with the quiet rustling of his pets. Here, among his scaled and chitinous friends, he felt some of the tension leave his body.

"Hey there," he murmured, approaching the ball python's enclosure. The snake raised its head, tongue flicking out to taste the air. Arys opened the tank, gently lifting the python. Its cool, smooth scales against his skin were comforting, grounding.

As he held the snake, Arys's mind wandered back to the events of the day. The strange call. The shadows he'd seen, felt, manipulated. It should have been terrifying, but instead, he felt... curious. Excited, even. For the first time in years, tomorrow held the promise of the unknown.

After ensuring all his pets were fed and comfortable, Arys retreated to his bedroom. He sat on the edge of his bed, staring at his alarm clock. 9:45 PM. In his normal routine, he'd be asleep in fifteen minutes, ready to wake at 5:30 AM and do it all over again.

But nothing felt normal anymore.

Arys reached out, his finger hovering over the alarm switch. The events of the day flashed through his mind – the monotony of the morning, the strange incident with Mrs. Holloway, the intense connection with the frightened caller, the collapse.

Something had awakened inside him. Something dark, powerful, and utterly fascinating.

His finger touched the switch. Flicked it off.

For the first time in three years, Arys Zellinger went to bed without setting his alarm. Tomorrow would come with or without the blaring 5:30 AM wake-up call. And for once, he was eager to see what it would bring.

As he drifted off to sleep, Arys could have sworn he felt the shadows in the room reaching out to him, caressing him like old friends welcoming him home. In his dreams, he stood at the edge of a vast, dark ocean, waves of shadow lapping at his feet.

And somewhere in the distance, a voice called his name.
